# Go CRUD Application

This is a simple CRUD application written in Go. It provides basic operations for managing this project.

## Folder Structure

Here is an overview of each component and its function in the layered architecture you are using:

- **database**: This folder likely contains code related to interacting with the database, such as data models, schemas, migrations, etc.

- **repository**: This folder houses the repositories, which are responsible for communicating with the database or any other data persistence mechanism. Repositories are used to perform read/write operations on the database and provide an abstraction between business logic and storage details.

- **service**: Here, you will find the services or business layer components. Services contain the business logic and orchestrate operations using repositories and other services if necessary. Their main purpose is to encapsulate complex logic and provide a consistent interface for use by other layers.

- **interface**: This folder could contain interfaces or contracts that define the methods and data structures used by different components. Interfaces help define how components interact with each other and promote code modularity and reusability.

- **handlers**: This folder could contain the request and response handlers or controllers. Handlers are responsible for handling HTTP requests or interactions with the system's external components. They transform requests and responses into formats that can be understood by the services or business layer components.

- **websocket**: Folder for managing real-time communication through WebSocket.

- **main.go**: This file generally contains the main entry point of the application. It is responsible for configuring and running the web server, establishing dependencies, and connecting the different components.

## Getting Started

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up the required environment variables in the `.env` file.
3. Run the database migrations using `go run database/migrations.go`.
4. Start the server using `go run main.go`.
5. Access the application through the provided endpoints.

Note: If you add or update any dependencies in your project, make sure to run `go mod download` again to ensure that all the dependencies are up to date and available.

Feel free to modify the code and folder structure according to your specific requirements and preferences.
